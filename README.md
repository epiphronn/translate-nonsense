# translate-nonsense
Uses Google translate to make your text become nonsense

### How to use: (Windows)
```
$ py make_nonsense.py text num_times init_lang
```

- text- the text you want to make nonsense
- num_times- amount of times to run through the translator (more is more nonsense)
- init_lang- the language of the input text, default to English

Example:
```
$ py make_nonsense.py "Hello, how are you today?" 7 en
> Good where are you today i'm going well
```

### Other:

To use, you obviously have to be connected to the internet (how else will you reach
  Google Translate). I have also included the examples.sh bash script if you want
  to see an example of this script.
